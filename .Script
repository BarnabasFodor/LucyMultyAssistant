StrText="World War II, also called Second World War, conflict that involved virtually every part of the world during the years 1939–45. The principal belligerents were the Axis powers—Germany, Italy, and Japan—and the Allies—France, Great Britain, the United States, the Soviet Union, and, to a lesser extent, China. The war was in many respects a continuation, after an uneasy 20-year hiatus, of the disputes left unsettled by World War I. The 40,000,000–50,000,000 deaths incurred in World War II make it the bloodiest conflict, as well as the largest war, in history. Along with World War I, World War II was one of the great watersheds of 20th-century geopolitical history. It resulted in the extension of the Soviet Union’s power to nations of eastern Europe, enabled a communist movement to eventually achieve power in China, and marked the decisive shift of power in the world away from the states of western Europe and toward the United States and the Soviet Union. The outbreak of war By the early part of 1939 the German dictator Adolf Hitler had become determined to invade and occupy Poland. Poland, for its part, had guarantees of French and British military support should it be attacked by Germany. Hitler intended to invade Poland anyway, but first he had to neutralize the possibility that the Soviet Union would resist the invasion of its western neighbour. Secret negotiations led on August 23–24 to the signing of the German-Soviet Nonaggression Pact in Moscow. In a secret protocol of this pact, the Germans and the Soviets agreed that Poland should be divided between them, with the western third of the country going to Germany and the eastern two-thirds being taken over by the U.S.S.R. Having achieved this cynical agreement, the other provisions of which stupefied Europe even without divulgence of the secret protocol, Hitler thought that Germany could attack Poland with no danger of Soviet or British intervention and gave orders for the invasion to start on August 26. News of the signing, on August 25, of a formal treaty of mutual assistance between Great Britain and Poland (to supersede a previous though temporary agreement) caused him to postpone the start of hostilities for a few days. He was still determined, however, to ignore the diplomatic efforts of the western powers to restrain him. Finally, at 12:40 pm on August 31, 1939, Hitler ordered hostilities against Poland to start at 4:45 the next morning. The invasion began as ordered. In response, Great Britain and France declared war on Germany on September 3, at 11:00 am and at 5:00 pm, respectively. World War II had begun."

StrText="The AMX Chasseur de chars is a French tier 8 premium medium tank.In 1946, the AMX company presented this design for a new vehicle. The powerful engine and light weight would have made the vehicle highly mobile, and the 90-mm gun was equipped with a mechanical ammunition system for a high rate of fire. However, the large dimensions of the vehicle, its thin armor, and the complexity of the design made it unappealing, and the project never advanced to a prototype.The closest match gameplay-wise for AMX CDC are Japanese medium tanks. Players experienced with Japanese mediums will feel right at home. The key features describing the CDC are the outstanding (almost light tank level) mobility, efficient armament, and last but not least paper-thin armor. And the armor is almost literally paper-thin in this case, not mentioning the unusually large size of the vehicle hull, which is bigger than most heavy tanks of its tier. Most tanks in tiers 9 and 10 will overmatch your 30 mm thick armor plates with ease, which means full damage from incoming High Explosive shells too. No wonder the tank needs an extraordinarily cautious and careful play style in order not to get killed in the very first minutes of the battle. A smart combination of using cover (guerilla peek-a-boo), its outstanding nimbleness and its great gun depression are vital to mastering this fragile but dangerous tank."
